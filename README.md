# Random Password Generator Documentation

## Overview
The Random Password Generator is a simple Python script that creates secure, customizable passwords based on user preferences. This tool helps users generate strong passwords for enhanced security.

## Features
- Customizable password length
- Option to include/exclude letters (uppercase and lowercase)
- Option to include/exclude numbers
- Option to include/exclude special symbols
- Input validation to ensure at least one character type is selected

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system
2. Clone or download the `User.py` file from this repository

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```
python User.py
```

Follow the prompts:
1. Enter the desired password length
2. Specify whether to include letters (y/n)
3. Specify whether to include numbers (y/n)
4. Specify whether to include symbols (y/n)

The script will then generate and display a random password based on your preferences.

## Example
```
Enter password length: 12
Include letters? (y/n): y
Include numbers? (y/n): y
Include symbols? (y/n): n
Generated password: aB7xK9pQ2rT3
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (random, string)

## Security Note
This script uses Python's `random` module which is sufficient for general purpose password generation. For cryptographic applications requiring higher security, consider using the `secrets` module instead.
